# WELPE.vim 
-----------

Dark colorscheme for vim, with a mixture of bright, saturated highlights
and pale, low-key colors for non-keyword syntax groups.

Currently I am still testing the harmonies, and adding support
for filetype specific syntax, as well as inbuilt lightline support.
**Note, that 8 and 16 color support may or may not be broken for now,
I am on to fix it**

As it is still in development, things might still radically change.
